# Munchkin Plugin
# ===============
# Plugin for fetching Munchkin card collections and data

## Overview
This plugin allows the Silhouette Card Maker to process Munchkin card collections from various sources. Munchkin is a humorous dungeon-crawling card game by Steve Jackson Games featuring monsters, treasures, and backstabbing mechanics.

## Important Note
**Munchkin is NOT a traditional trading card game (TCG) like Magic: The Gathering or PokÃ©mon.** It is a standalone card game with a specific structure:

- **Door Cards:** Monsters, curses, and other obstacles
- **Treasure Cards:** Items, equipment, and loot
- **No Competitive Tournaments:** Focus is on casual, humorous gameplay
- **Cooperative Backstabbing:** Players help each other until it's time to betray

This plugin treats Munchkin as a card collection manager rather than a competitive TCG plugin.

## Installation
1. Place this plugin folder in the `plugins/` directory of your Silhouette Card Maker
2. Ensure dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install requests lxml
   ```

## Usage

### Command Line
```bash
# Get cards from Munchkin CCG database
python munchkin_cli.py --source ccg --num-cards 20

# Fetch images for card collection
python munchkin_cli.py --mode collection --fetch-images

# Search for specific card
python munchkin_cli.py --card-name "Potion of General Studliness"
```

### GUI Integration
The plugin can be called from the main GUI through the plugin system. It will:
1. Prompt for processing mode (cards, collection, or search)
2. Fetch card data from Munchkin CCG database and community sites
3. Optionally attempt to download card images
4. Save results for card creation
