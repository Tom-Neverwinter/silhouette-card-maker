# ========================
# Plugin for fetching Star Realms Trading Card Game decks and images

## Overview

## Features
- **Tournament Scraping:** Extract deck lists from official Star Realms sites and community resources
- **Multiple Data Sources:** Support for official card gallery, BoardGameGeek, and tier lists
- **Card Image Fetching:** Framework for downloading card images from official sources
- **Batch Processing:** Handle multiple tournaments and decks efficiently

## Installation
1. Place this plugin folder in the `plugins/` directory of your Silhouette Card Maker
2. Ensure dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install requests lxml
   ```

## Usage

### Command Line
```bash
# Scrape recent cards from official card gallery
python sr_cli.py --source official --max-cards 50

# Fetch images for scraped cards
python sr_cli.py --fetch-images --output-dir game/front

# Process specific collection
python sr_cli.py --collection "My Star Realms Deck" --save-collection

# Search for specific cards
python sr_cli.py --search-card "Trade Pod"
```

### GUI Integration
The plugin can be called from the main GUI through the plugin system. It will:
1. Prompt for data source and scraping preferences
2. Scrape card data from available sources
3. Optionally attempt to download card images
4. Save results for card creation

## Data Sources
- **Official Card Gallery:** https://www.starrealms.com/card-gallery/ - Primary card database
- **BoardGameGeek:** Complete card lists and community resources
- **Tier Lists:** Community-driven card rankings and analysis
- **Community Resources:** Reddit (r/starrealms), Discord communities, and tournament sites

## Current Status
- âœ… Basic plugin structure implemented
- âœ… Card scraping framework from multiple sources
- âœ… Collection management system

- ðŸ”„ Tournament deck scraping (would need community site integration)

## Limitations

## Future Enhancements

## Technical Notes

## Card Types
- **Ships:** Combat vessels that attack and provide trade
