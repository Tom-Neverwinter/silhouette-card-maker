# Fluxx Plugin
# ============
# Plugin for fetching Fluxx card collections and data

## Overview
This plugin allows the Silhouette Card Maker to process Fluxx card collections from various sources. Fluxx is a unique card game by Looney Labs where the rules and win conditions constantly change as cards are played.

## Important Note
**Fluxx is NOT a traditional trading card game (TCG) like Magic: The Gathering or PokÃ©mon.** It is a standalone card game with ever-changing rules:

- **Rules Change:** Cards modify how the game is played (Draw 2, Play 3, etc.)
- **Win Conditions Change:** Goals determine how to win and change constantly
- **No Fixed Strategy:** The game evolves as you play
- **Humorous Theme:** Light-hearted gameplay with funny card effects

This plugin treats Fluxx as a card collection manager focusing on the unique rule-changing mechanics.

## Installation
1. Place this plugin folder in the `plugins/` directory of your Silhouette Card Maker
2. Ensure dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install requests lxml
   ```

## Usage

### Command Line
```bash
# Get cards from Looney Labs
python fluxx_cli.py --source looney --card-type keeper --num-cards 10

# Fetch images for card collection
python fluxx_cli.py --mode collection --fetch-images

# Search for specific card
python fluxx_cli.py --card-name "The Brain"
```

### GUI Integration
The plugin can be called from the main GUI through the plugin system. It will:
1. Prompt for processing mode (cards, collection, or search)
2. Fetch card data from Looney Labs and BoardGameGeek
3. Optionally attempt to download card images
4. Save results for card creation
